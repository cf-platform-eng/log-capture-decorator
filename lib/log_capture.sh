# These magic incantations cause all stdout and stderr messages from
# the remainder of this process tree to be sent to our log_capture.py
# sidecar processes. In this particular example, those in turn echo
# back to stdout and stderr with a prefix to show that the log capture
# worked. A real implementation of the sidecar might forward the messages
# to a log drain, and make the echo-back optional.
